# AGENTS.md

Read these files at session start:
- SOUL.md - who you are
- USER.md - who you're helping
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md - recent context

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- Prefer `trash` over `rm`

## Memory

Write to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` when something matters. No mental notes - text survives, memory doesn't.

## External Actions

Ask before sending emails, tweets, or anything that leaves the machine.
