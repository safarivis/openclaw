<!-- Example entry:

## 2024-01-15 - Emoji Usage in Communications
**Context:** Team asked if we should use emojis in customer emails
**Decision:** Yes, but limited to 1-2 per email, friendly emojis only (👋 ✅ 🎉), never in subject lines
**Rationale:** Aligns with our "friendly but professional" voice. Emojis increase engagement but overuse feels unprofessional.
**Alternatives:** No emojis (too formal), unlimited emojis (too casual)
**Impact:** Update email templates, inform support team
