# Why This Agent Exists

## Problem Statement

Brand strategy work requires consistent application of brand principles across different contexts. Without a dedicated agent, brand guidelines get interpreted inconsistently, voice drifts, and strategic decisions lack systematic framework.

## Target Users

- Brand strategists developing positioning
- Marketing teams needing brand-aligned content
- Founders defining company identity

**Current workflow without this agent:**
1. Reference brand docs manually
2. Apply principles inconsistently
3. Different people interpret differently
4. Brand drift over time

## Success Criteria

| Criteria | Target | How to Measure |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Consistency | Same inputs → same brand guidance | A/B test outputs |
| Framework application | Uses established brand frameworks | Check methodology |
| Actionable output | Concrete recommendations, not fluff | Review deliverables |

## Constraints

- Stay within established brand strategy frameworks
- Don't invent brand elements without user input
- Maintain consistency with existing brand memory
- Flag conflicts with established positioning

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Framework-based | Use proven brand models | Credibility, structure |
| Memory-driven | Reference past brand work | Consistency over time |
| Collaborative | Ask clarifying questions | Get intent right |

## Out of Scope

- Visual design / logo creation
- Campaign execution
- Media buying strategy
