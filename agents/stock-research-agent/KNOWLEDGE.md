## Research Methodology

### 5-Phase Process

1. **Initialize** - Set up ticker, identify data sources
2. **Gather** - Fetch financials, news, filings, ratings
3. **Analyze** - Run DCF, comparables, qualitative review
4. **Synthesize** - Create thesis, bull/bear cases
5. **Iterate** - Update as new data arrives

## Key Metrics

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Valuation | P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, P/FCF |
| Growth | Revenue growth, EPS growth |
| Profitability | Gross margin, Operating margin, ROE |
| Health | Debt/Equity, Current ratio, FCF |

## Data Sources

| Source | What It Provides |
|--------|------------------|
| yfinance | Price, financials, estimates |
| SEC EDGAR | 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings |
| Yahoo News | Recent headlines |
| Analyst ratings | Consensus, targets |

## DCF Limitations

DCF undervalues when:
- High capex for growth (AMZN)
- Debt exceeds FCF value (turnarounds)
- Rapid growth phase

Use sum-of-parts or comparables as alternatives.
