| ROIC | 11.3% | ~10% | Solid |
| EBITDA Margin | 16.4% | ~12% | Premium |
| Current Ratio | 2.06 | ~1.5 | Strong |
| Debt/Equity | 1.06 | ~1.0 | Adequate |

### Simple DCF Model

**Assumptions:**
- Base FCF: ~$170M (estimated from EV/FCF of 28.6x on ~$4.9B EV)
- Growth Years 1-5: 4% (in-line with guidance)
- Terminal Growth: 2.5%
- WACC: 8.5%

**DCF Output:**
```
Year 1: $177M
Year 2: $184M
Year 3: $191M
Year 4: $199M
Year 5: $207M
Terminal Value: $3,538M (207 × 1.025 / (0.085 - 0.025))

PV of FCFs: $757M
PV of Terminal: $2,356M
Enterprise Value: $3,113M
Less Net Debt: ~$400M (estimated)
Equity Value: ~$2,713M
Per Share (65M shares): ~$42
```

**DCF Implies:** Stock is overvalued (~$80 vs $42 intrinsic)

**Sensitivity:**
| WACC / Terminal Growth | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% |
|------------------------|------|------|------|
| 7.5% | $52 | $62 | $77 |
| 8.5% | $38 | $42 | $48 |
| 9.5% | $29 | $32 | $35 |

Even with optimistic assumptions (7.5% WACC, 3% terminal), DCF struggles to justify current price.

## Phase 4: Synthesis ✓

### Bull Case 🐂

1. **Golf Participation Structural Shift**
   - 47.2M Americans played in 2024 (+38% vs pre-pandemic)
   - Younger demographics (18-34) driving growth
   - Could sustain premium equipment demand

2. **Pricing Power Durability**
   - Titleist maintains premium positioning
   - Pro V1 price increases stick
   - Brand loyalty creates repeat purchases

3. **Shareholder Returns**
   - 9-year dividend streak
   - Low payout ratio (25%) enables growth + buybacks
   - Capital-light model post-R&D

4. **Market Share Gains**
   - FootJoy gaining in apparel
   - New product launches drive upgrades
   - International expansion opportunity (Asia-Pacific fastest growing)

**Bull Target:** $100+ (assumes multiple expansion, 16-17x EV/EBITDA)

### Bear Case 🐻

1. **Valuation Fully Stretched**
   - At top of historical range
   - Analyst downgrades citing limited upside
   - 86% run needs to consolidate

2. **Post-Pandemic Normalization**
   - Golf boom moderating
   - Equipment upgrade cycle slowing
   - Consumer discretionary pressure in 2026

3. **Competition Intensifying**
   - Callaway aggressive post-Topgolf separation
   - TaylorMade gaining share in clubs
   - DTC brands targeting younger golfers

4. **DCF Disconnect**
   - Current price implies aggressive assumptions
   - Fundamentals don't support $80+ sustainably

**Bear Target:** $55-60 (revert to 10-12x EV/EBITDA)

### Investment Thesis

**NEUTRAL - Quality at Full Price**

Acushnet is an exceptional business with:
- Dominant brand (Titleist)
- Strong moats (tour usage, premium positioning)
- Consistent financials (16% EBITDA margins, 24% ROE)
- Shareholder-friendly capital allocation

However, current valuation leaves no margin of safety:
- EV/EBITDA at top of historical range
- P/E above median
- DCF suggests 40-50% overvaluation
- Analysts downgrading on valuation

**Action:** HOLD for existing positions. WAIT for 20-30% pullback to $55-65 range before initiating new positions.

**Catalyst Watch:**
- Quarterly earnings misses (trigger correction)
- Macro slowdown (golf participation dip)
- Competitive share loss (bull case broken)
