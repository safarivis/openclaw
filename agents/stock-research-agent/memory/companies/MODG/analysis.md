## Financial Summary (Pre-Separation, FY 2024)

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Revenue | $4.06B | Includes Topgolf |
| Revenue Growth | -7.8% | Weak |
| Gross Margin | 30.9% | Below GOLF (48%) |
| Operating Margin | 3.2% | Struggling |
| EBITDA | $491M | |
| Net Income | -$1.5B | Topgolf impairment |
| EPS (TTM) | -$8.19 | Non-cash charges |
| Free Cash Flow | $93M | Positive |

### Post-Separation Pro Forma (~2026)

| Metric | Estimated Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Core Revenue | ~$2.0B (Golf Equipment + Active Lifestyle) |
| Topgolf Contribution | 40% of equity earnings |
| Debt | ~$3.5B - $1B = ~$2.5B |
| Market Cap | ~$2.7B |
| EV | ~$5.2B (reduced) |

---

## Balance Sheet

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Market Cap | $2.70B | |
| Enterprise Value | $6.29B | High due to debt |
| Total Cash | $866M | Strong post-deal |

---

## Valuation

| Metric | MODG/CALY | GOLF | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| P/E (TTM) | N/A (negative) | 26x | Not comparable |
| P/E (Forward) | 35.8x | 25.0x | CALY more expensive |
| EV/EBITDA | 12.8x | 18.6x | **CALY cheaper** |
| EV/Revenue | 1.5x | 2.6x | **CALY cheaper** |
| P/B | 1.1x | 6.7x | **CALY much cheaper** |

**Key insight:** On EV multiples, CALY is significantly cheaper than GOLF. But higher debt and execution risk explain the discount.

### DCF Analysis

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Base FCF | $93M |
| Growth | Negative to flat |
| WACC | 9% |
| Terminal Growth | 2.5% |

**Result:** Negative intrinsic value due to debt exceeding enterprise value

**DCF Limitation:** The DCF model breaks down here because:
1. Net debt ($3.6B) > Enterprise Value from FCF ($1.1B)
2. Recent FCF depressed by restructuring
3. Post-separation FCF will be different

**Alternative valuation:** Sum-of-parts
- Golf Equipment (~$2B revenue × 1.5x = $3B EV)
- 40% Topgolf stake (~$440M)
- Less Net Debt (~$2.5B post-repayment)
- **Equity Value: ~$940M = ~$5/share**

Even SOTP suggests current price ($14.68) is optimistic without significant improvement.

   - Focus on core golf equipment
   - Simpler story for investors
   - Management bandwidth freed up

2. **Deleveraging**
   - $1B debt repaid
   - $200M buyback authorized

   - EV/EBITDA 12.8x vs GOLF 18.6x
   - P/B 1.1x vs GOLF 6.7x
   - If margins improve, multiple expansion possible

5. **Golf Tailwinds**
   - Participation up 38% vs pre-pandemic
   - Equipment upgrade cycles

**Bull Target:** $20-25 (assumes margin recovery, multiple expansion)

---

## Bear Case 🐻

1. **Debt Still High**
   - ~$2.5B net debt post-deal
   - Limits flexibility
   - Interest expense drag

2. **Topgolf Value Destruction**
   - Paid $2.6B, sold 60% for ~$660M implied
   - Retained 40% may continue to underperform
   - Management credibility damaged

3. **Margin Gap**
   - Gross margin 31% vs Titleist 48%
   - Operating margin 3% vs Titleist 14%
   - Structural disadvantage?

4. **Revenue Declining**
   - -7.8% YoY
   - Jack Wolfskin, Korea weak
   - Can they grow the core?

5. **Analysts Skeptical**
   - Mean target $13.28 < current $14.68
   - Price already reflects optimism

**Bear Target:** $8-10 (if turnaround stalls)

---

## Investment Thesis

**SPECULATIVE BUY - High Risk / High Reward**

**The Case:**
Callaway is a turnaround story. The Topgolf separation removes a major overhang and lets management focus on what they do best - golf equipment. At 12.8x EV/EBITDA vs. Titleist at 18.6x, there's room for multiple expansion if execution improves.

**The Risks:**
- Debt still high
- Margins structurally worse than Titleist
- Revenue declining
- Already trading above analyst targets

**Action:**

| Scenario | Price | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Current | $14.68 | HOLD - Wait for pullback |
| $10-12 | | BUY - Better risk/reward |
| $8-10 | | STRONG BUY - Margin of safety |
| $18+ | | SELL - Fully valued |

**Catalyst Watch:**
- Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 2026) - First post-separation quarter
- Quantum launch reception
- Margin improvement signals
- Further debt reduction
