| P/E (TTM) | 34.5x | 31.2x | 21.0x | Premium |
| P/E (Forward) | 28.5x | 27.8x | 18.5x | Reasonable |

| Growth Years 6-10 | 8% |
| Terminal Growth | 3% |
| WACC | 10% |

**DCF Intrinsic Value:** $185-220/share

1. High capex for growth (AWS data centers, logistics)
2. Margin expansion potential not fully captured
3. Optionality in new businesses (healthcare, grocery)

### Sum-of-Parts Valuation

| International Retail | 0.5x EV/Rev | $75B |
| Prime/Ads/Other | 5x EBITDA | $350B |

| Less: Net Debt | | -$44B |
| **Equity Value** | | **$1.58T** |
| **Per Share** | | **$150** |

**SOTP suggests:** Current price ($238) includes significant growth premium. Fair if execution continues.

## Investment Thesis

**BUY - Quality Compounder at Fair Value**

**The Case:**
Amazon is a unique combination of dominant positions in e-commerce (#1), cloud (#1), and advertising (#3). AWS provides the profitability engine while retail provides the customer base and data moat. Under Andy Jassy, the company has transformed from growth-at-all-costs to profitable growth, with operating margins improving from 2% to 11%+.

**The Risks:**
- Antitrust overhang (but unlikely breakup)
- Azure growing faster than AWS
- Valuation premium requires execution
- High capital intensity

**Action:**

| Scenario | Price | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Current | $238 | **BUY** - Fair value for quality |
| $200-220 | | **STRONG BUY** - Margin of safety |
| $180 or below | | **BACK UP THE TRUCK** |
| $300+ | | HOLD - Fully valued |
| $350+ | | TRIM - Extended |

**Catalyst Watch:**
- Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 2026) - Holiday quarter
- AWS re-acceleration continuation
- Prime Video advertising metrics
- FTC lawsuit developments
- Project Kuiper launch timeline
