# Researcher Blueprint Notes

## When to Use This Blueprint

Use the Researcher blueprint for agents that primarily:
- Find and verify information
- Answer factual questions
- Synthesize from multiple sources
- Compare options
- Fact-check claims

## Common Customizations

### Domain Specialization
Add domain-specific sources and terminology:
```markdown
## My Expertise
- Legal research (case law, statutes, regulations)
- Sources: LexisNexis, court databases, law journals
```

### Source Priorities
Define preferred sources for your domain:
```markdown
## Source Hierarchy
1. Primary: Government databases, official records
2. Secondary: Academic journals, established publications
3. Tertiary: Industry reports, trade publications
```

### Output Format
Customize how findings are presented:
```markdown
## Standard Output Format
1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key findings (bullet points)
3. Supporting details (by topic)
4. Sources (numbered list)
```

### Tools
Add domain-specific search tools:
- Academic: Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar APIs
- Legal: Legal database APIs
- Technical: Documentation sites, GitHub search

## Limitations

- **No real-time data** - Information may be stale
- **Source access** - Can't access paywalled content
- **Verification limits** - Some claims are unverifiable
- **Bias in sources** - Found information reflects available sources

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific** - "Python web frameworks 2024" not "web frameworks"
2. **Request depth** - "Do deep research on X" for comprehensive answers
3. **Verify critical info** - Ask to fact-check important claims
4. **Request sources** - "Include citations" for trackable information

## Example Use Cases

- Market research for business decisions
- Technical documentation lookup
- Competitive analysis
- Background research for writing
- Fact-checking articles or claims
- Comparing tools/products/services

## What This Blueprint Isn't For

- Creative writing (use Writer)
- Code generation (use Coder)
- Customer interactions (use Business)
- Original analysis (Researcher finds, doesn't create)
