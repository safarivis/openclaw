# Why This Agent Exists

## Problem Statement

What specific problem does this agent solve? Be concrete.

```
<!-- Example: "Users spend 2+ hours per week manually researching competitor pricing,
often missing updates because they forget to check." -->
```

## Target Users

Who will use this agent? When? What's their current workflow?

```
<!-- Example: "Product managers during weekly competitive analysis.
Currently: manual Google searches → spreadsheet → presentation slides" -->
```

## Success Criteria

How do we know it's working? Define measurable outcomes.

| Criteria | Target | How to Measure |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| <!-- Example: Time saved --> | <!-- 80% reduction --> | <!-- Compare manual vs agent --> |
| <!-- Example: Coverage --> | <!-- Track all 5 competitors --> | <!-- Verify in weekly report --> |

## Constraints

What must this agent NOT do? What are the hard limits?

- <!-- Example: Never share competitive data externally -->
- <!-- Example: Don't make purchasing decisions -->
- <!-- Example: Max 10 API calls per run (cost control) -->

## Key Decisions

Document important choices and their rationale.

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| <!-- Example: Data source --> | <!-- RSS + web scrape --> | <!-- Real-time, free, comprehensive --> |
| <!-- Example: Output format --> | <!-- Markdown report --> | <!-- Easy to paste into Notion --> |

## Out of Scope

What are we explicitly NOT building (for now)?

- <!-- Example: Price prediction / forecasting -->
- <!-- Example: Automated alerts -->
- <!-- Example: Historical trend analysis -->

## Open Questions

Unresolved issues to track.

- [ ] <!-- Example: Should we include international competitors? -->
- [ ] <!-- Example: How often should it run - daily or weekly? -->
