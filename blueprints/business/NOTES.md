# Business Blueprint Notes

## When to Use This Blueprint

Use the Business blueprint for agents that primarily:
- Handle customer support inquiries
- Qualify and engage sales leads
- Execute business processes
- Manage communications and scheduling
- Track and report business data

## Common Customizations

### Industry Focus
Adapt for specific industries:
```markdown
## Domain
SaaS B2B company selling to developers
- Technical audience
- Usage-based pricing
- Self-serve with enterprise tier
```

### Escalation Policies
Define when to escalate:
```markdown
## Escalation Triggers
IMMEDIATE escalation:
- Legal threats
- Security concerns
- Refund requests over $500
- Executive complaints

Escalate within 1 hour:
- Billing disputes
- Feature complaints from enterprise
- Churn indicators
```

### Brand Voice
Set communication style:
```markdown
## Communication Style
- Friendly and helpful, not corporate
- Technical but not jargon-heavy
- Acknowledge frustration before solving
- Always offer next steps
```

### Process Definitions
Document key workflows:
```markdown
## Support Process
1. Acknowledge within 5 minutes
2. Search KB for solution
3. If found, provide with links
4. If not, escalate to tier 2
5. Always follow up within 24 hours
```

## Limitations

- **No authority for legal/financial** - Must defer to specialists
- **Requires integrations** - Needs CRM, ticketing, email access
- **Policy dependent** - Needs clear rules to follow
- **Human oversight** - Important decisions need approval

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Define clear processes** - Document workflows explicitly
2. **Set boundaries** - What can/can't the agent decide
3. **Provide scripts** - Templates for common situations
4. **Include escalation paths** - When and how to hand off
5. **Regular reviews** - Check interactions for quality

## Example Use Cases

- Customer support triage
- Lead qualification
- Appointment scheduling
- Follow-up communications
- Data entry and updates
- Report generation

## What This Blueprint Isn't For

- Code writing (use Coder)
- Content creation (use Writer)
- Deep research (use Researcher)
- Strategic decisions (needs human)

## Compliance Notes

Business agents often handle:
- Personal information (privacy policies apply)
- Financial data (PCI compliance)
- Health information (HIPAA if applicable)

Ensure proper data handling and access controls.
