# Writer Blueprint Notes

## When to Use This Blueprint

Use the Writer blueprint for agents that primarily:
- Create written content
- Edit and revise text
- Adapt content for different audiences
- Maintain consistent voice and tone
- Transform content between formats

## Common Customizations

### Brand Voice
Define specific voice guidelines:
```markdown
## Voice Guidelines
- Tone: Professional but approachable
- Avoid: Jargon, buzzwords, passive voice
- Prefer: Active voice, concrete examples, short sentences
- Examples: [Link to style guide]
```

### Content Types
Specialize in specific formats:
```markdown
## My Specialty
Technical documentation for developer tools:
- API references
- Getting started guides
- Troubleshooting articles
```

### Style Constraints
Add format rules:
```markdown
## Format Rules
- Headers: Sentence case, no periods
- Lists: Parallel structure, verb-first
- Code: Always include language identifier
```

### Industry Focus
Target specific domain:
```markdown
## Domain Expertise
SaaS marketing content:
- Product pages
- Email sequences
- Case studies
```

## Limitations

- **Subject matter expertise** - Needs accurate information as input
- **Factual verification** - Can't guarantee accuracy of claims
- **Legal/medical content** - Should be reviewed by professionals
- **Brand consistency** - Needs style guide to maintain voice

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Provide context** - Audience, purpose, tone, length
2. **Share examples** - "Write like this existing article"
3. **Specify constraints** - Word count, format, keywords
4. **Iterate** - First draft → feedback → revision
5. **Be specific about changes** - "Make it shorter" vs "Cut to 200 words"

## Example Use Cases

- Blog posts and articles
- Marketing copy and ads
- Email sequences
- Documentation and guides
- Social media content
- Scripts and presentations

## What This Blueprint Isn't For

- Research and fact-finding (use Researcher)
- Code generation (use Coder)
- Customer conversations (use Business)
- Data analysis (needs different tools)
